                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a new game desinger with a pasion for retro games. I'm a bit slow when it comes to making games
                    so it does take awhile for me to make one, but when there made there pretty good. In my free time I
                    like too play videogames, tubing, swimming, binge watching tv shows, and writing. But when im not 
                    doing that I'll talk with friends or go to the mall.
